## ðŸŽ® Open Source Script for Arsenal (In Lua)

### Description

This project is a Lua script originally designed for the Roblox game Arsenal. While it worked correctly in the past, bugsâ€”such as a white screen appearing after death when the script is injectedâ€”make its usage challenging.

The script is open source to allow others to study, improve, or fix it. Note that I do not plan to update it.

### Features

- ðŸ”§ Easy-to-understand code for Lua developers.
- ðŸ”’ Compatible with most Lua injectors.
- ðŸŽ® Scripts tailored for Roblox Arsenal.

### Limitations

- ðŸ”´ Known bug: white screen when the player dies.
- ðŸ”´ The script is no longer maintained.

### Installation

1. Load the script into your Lua injector.
2. Test the script in Arsenal.
